Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the process of extracting useful information and knowledge from educational 
data. EDM identiﬁes patterns and trends from educational data, which can be used to improve academic 
curriculum, teaching and assessment methods, and students’ academic performance. Thus, this study uses EDM 
techniques to analyze the performance of higher secondary students in Bangladesh. Three crucial categories, 
such as good, average, and poorly-performing students are considered for analysis. Four signiﬁcant aspects 
of students’ performance are emphasized for evaluation in this study. Firstly, predicting students’ academic 
ﬁnal examination performance in terms of internal college examination. Secondly, identifying all subjects’ 
impact on classiﬁer performance. Thirdly, examining students’ performance progression during their studies and 
relating with subject-wise improvement or degradation. Fourthly, discovering consistent patterns of students’ 
performance based on previous internal examination performance trends. The classiﬁcation result reveals the 
correlation between internal examination and ﬁnal academic performance. In addition, it resembles the predictor 
subjects for academic performance. The result also highlights the consistent pattern of students’ consecutive 
internal examinations’ performance. Thereafter, college administration can take necessary supportive initiatives 
for poorly-performing students and encourage good-performer students to continue excelling.
1. Introduction
The development of a country is not possible without skilled peo-
ple. One of the fundamental ways to enrich skills is through educa-
tion (Maxwell, 2012). That’s why the education system of a country 
focuses more on educating every citizen. However, in Bangladesh, a 
considerable percentage of college students today perform poorly on 
their academic examinations because of drawbacks such as low qual-
ity teaching and limited learning facilities, inadequate technical and 
vocational training, socioeconomic factors, lack of motivation and en-
gagement, and signiﬁcant school dropout rate (Kono et al., 2018). As 
a result, the dream of building a skilled nation is at risk. If we can 
identify the reasons behind poor academic performance, then by ad-
dressing those issues, both students and the nation can beneﬁt. Data 
mining can help us identify the reasons behind poor academic perfor-
mance and can also provide valuable insights into current performance

1 Higher Secondary Certiﬁcate (HSC) is a public examination in Bangladesh conducted by the Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education under the Ministry 
of Education. HSC is the continuation of the Secondary Education Courses and it precedes the Tertiary Education governed by the universities. Class XI-XII (intend 
to sit for HSC examination) roughly covers the 16-18 age group in the context of Bangladesh.
trends and potential improvements. Nowadays, huge amounts of stu-
dents’ data are available. Extracting certain pattern or knowledge from 
those data is called data mining (Han et al., 2022). Educational data 
mining is one of the major ﬁelds of data mining, which can be cate-
gorized as prediction, relationship mining, clustering, discovery within 
models, and distillation of data for human judgment (Baker, 2010). This 
study aims to explore students’ academic performance from various as-
pects focusing on current performance patterns and further performance 
improvement scopes.
In 2020, because of COVID-19 spread-out, government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of Bangladesh rescheduled the Higher Secondary Cer-
tiﬁcate (HSC)1 examination several times and ﬁnally decided that HSC 
examination would not be conducted considering the mass health con-
cern and infection issue due to the pandemic. Therefore, the government 
followed education experts suggestion for deciding result of more than 
1.3 million HSC candidates (Star, 2021)(Tribune, 2020). Accordingly,

the government decided that the HSC result would be published based 
on the Junior School Certiﬁcate (JSC)2 and Secondary School Certiﬁcate 
(SSC)3 results (Alo, 2020). This decision is to be appreciated considering 
the COVID-19 pandemic situation as it was quite eﬀective for reducing 
academic session jam. Academic session jam refers to a situation where 
the regular academic calendar or session of an educational institution 
gets disrupted or delayed due to various reasons such as strikes, protests, 
natural disasters, administrative issues, or any other factors that pre-
vent the smooth functioning of the academic year (The Finance Today, 
2023). For this reason, this study has analyzed to ﬁnd out what could be 
the scenario if the HSC examination had been conducted by proposing 
GPA (Grade Point Average) calculation techniques that are comparable 
with board GPA.4 In a word, comparison among two proposed GPA cal-
culations with board GPA in terms of academic performance relevancy 
clearly resembles the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
In this work, we worked on predicting students’ HSC examination 
performance and proposed two diﬀerent approaches for the calculation 
of HSC GPA using their internal college examination marks. Then we 
compared the generated results with the education board provided GPA 
using diﬀerent classiﬁcation methods. Also, this study aims to determine 
which subjects have less or more impact on students’ results (obtained 
GPA). For our other objectives, we analyzed the data to ﬁnd out in which 
subject a student performed highly or poorly. Additionally, we iden-
tiﬁed subjects for each student that can greatly assist in performance 
improvement with minor eﬀort. Besides, an initiative has been estab-
lished to distinguish all subjects as a performance booster, degraded, or 
at-risk based on the number of aﬀected students. This aspect of perfor-
mance observation may prove signiﬁcantly helpful in reducing student 
failure in future examinations. Furthermore, we attempted to identify 
students who had performed consistently in their internal examinations 
much earlier so that they could improve their upcoming performance 
with proper guidance. Eventually, academic performance-related use-
ful information, patterns, trends, and insights provided by the various 
aspects followed by the research goals of this study can surely guide stu-
dents to understand current performance, lackings in performance, and 
alert them earlier to improve performance. The authorities can also act 
eﬀectively and update academic strategies accordingly.
1.1. Research objectives
This study aims to analyze the performance of students studying a 
two-year HSC program of humanities division at a college in Bangladesh. 
The objective is to observe the continuous academic performance of 
both student groups and individual student precisely. Also, the focus 
is on to provide useful knowledge and patterns regarding students’ aca-
demic performance to the concerned teachers and college authorities. 
This study seeks to accomplish four research objectives as follows.
• Firstly, several classiﬁcation models are generated to predict the 
performance of students at the end of the HSC degree. To build these 
classiﬁers, only academic internal examination marks of ﬁrst and 
2 Junior School Certiﬁcate (JSC) is a public examination taken by students 
in Bangladesh after the successful completion of eight years of schooling. It is 
introduced in 2010. It is followed by the Secondary School Certiﬁcate (SSC) 
examination.
3 Secondary School Certiﬁcate (SSC) is a public examination in Bangladesh 
conducted by the Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education under the 
Ministry of Education. SSC is held based on the books of classes IX and X, which 
are usually the same.
4 In this paper, board GPA refers to the Grade Point Average (GPA) 
calculation of HSC examination, during COVID-19 pandemic, taken by 
the Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education. The correspond-
ing grading system calculation, used during COVID-19 pandemic, is 
available at https://en .prothomalo .com /youth /education /hsc -results -of -2020 -

second year within college are used. No categorical attributes (so-
cioeconomic and demographic factors) of students are considered. 
Classiﬁcation models provide a summary of students’ academic per-
formance. This approach will enable the college authority to keep 
track of institutional overall performance in HSC examination based 
on internal examination subject marks only.
• Secondly, we aim to derive predictor subjects and their impact that 
can serve as eﬀective indicators for students’ performance predic-
tion in HSC examination. As a result, we will be able to identify 
good, average and poor performer students and support at-risk stu-
dents as soon as possible. This can be accomplished by using human 
interpretable classiﬁers that provides simple visual classiﬁcation 
outcomes.
According to (Asif et al., 2017), using a random classiﬁer other than 
decision tree will not be a good choice to ﬁnd predictor subjects, 
because the prediction capacity and interpretability of a classiﬁer 
model may need to be traded oﬀ. Therefore, we used Decision Tree 
(DT), a classiﬁer algorithm explained in section 3 for this study. 
The decision tree is the most simple model that gives highly in-
terpretable decision tree graph outcomes for human visualization 
based on diﬀerent statistical feature selection criteria (Asif et al., 
2017).
DT with diﬀerent impurity measures, such as information gain, gini 
index and accuracy, may sometimes lead to biased results (Raileanu 
& Stoﬀel, 2004). According to (Han et al., 2022), information gain 
gives bias result in favor of multivalued attributes in dataset. Gini 
index has tendency to favor tests that result in equal-sized and pure 
partitions (Liu et al., 2018). Besides, it can not handle large number 
of classes and gets biased to multivalued attributes as well. Due to 
imbalanced class distribution in dataset, DT with accuracy produces 
biased trees and favors the majority class (Han et al., 2022).
Considering the circumstances, we suggested an approach to iden-
tify predictor subjects and their impact. We did the task by observ-
ing the DT graph node outcomes using the concept of voting. This 
greatly paves the way to compare classiﬁer performance and stu-
dent performance-subjects correlation between the proposed and 
board GPA approach. This helps to reach an important conclu-
sion about eﬃcient attribute selection and attribute-label associa-
tion. Furthermore, this approach opens up an opportunity for non-
technical individuals to comprehend our second research objective. 
It allows them to easily interpret and relate student performance 
with subjects without requiring prior knowledge of machine learn-
ing.
• Thirdly, through our proposed approach we investigated how stu-
dents’ academic performance progresses over the two-year aca-
demic study period. Using average marks in internal examination 
as performance baseline, the subject-wise continuous progression 
of each student can be determined. The subjects that boost over-
all GPA are deﬁned as booster subjects and the subjects that are 
responsible for decreasing the GPA are called degrader subjects. 
Again, failure-prone subjects are addressed as at-risk subjects. This 
way every student’s progression through internal examination can 
be properly examined. Besides, determining booster subjects and 
degrader subjects based on the number of aﬀected students, few of 
them can be shortlisted to improve subject-wise academic perfor-
mance. The proposed continuous progression model presents both 
highly interpretable and visually clear outcomes that even non-
technical persons like college teachers and students can understand 
easily. This paves the way to closely monitor students and detect 
at-risk subjects. Consequently, students’ result degradation can be 
signiﬁcantly reduced with immediate supportive measures.
• Fourthly, consistent performance pattern detection during academic 
periods based on two consecutive previous internal examination 
performance trends can be helpful. It can remarkably help in detect-
ing the bright and poor performer students (e.g., struggling, at-risk) 
well in advance of their upcoming internal examinations. It can

preciously help in triggering timely intervention for performance 
improvement through special teaching and assessment methods.
However, the objectives can be summarized as follows:
• Objective 1: Predicting students’ ﬁnal academic performance based 
on internal exam performance using several classiﬁers. Addition-
ally, conducting a comparative analysis between proposed GPA and 
board GPA in terms of relevancy with internal examination perfor-
mance.
• Objective 2: Identifying predictor subjects and their impact on 
students’ performance prediction, besides comparing between pro-
posed GPA and board GPA in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and 
feature selection eﬃciency.
• Objective 3: Investigating students’ performance progression dur-
ing academic two-year period.
i) Finding individual student’s GPA booster subjects and degrader 
subjects.
ii) Discovering individual student’s at-risk subjects.
iii) Categorizing all subjects into at-risk subjects, performance 
booster, and degrader subjects.
iv) Pinpointing present performance statistics and performance 
booster subjects with low eﬀort for individual student perfor-
mance improvement.
• Objective 4: Finding a consistent pattern of students’ performance 
based on previous consecutive internal examinations’ performance 
trends.
The remainder of the paper is organized into several sections. In 
section 2, the work done by distinguished researchers considering edu-
cational data are discussed. The classiﬁers which we used for classiﬁca-
tion purposes are illustrated in section 3. In section 4, the dataset used 
and the workﬂow of the proposed approach are discussed. The detailed 
performance analysis of our work is investigated in section 5. The lim-
itations and possible future work scopes of this study are discussed in 
section 6. In section 7, the theoretical and pedagogical implications of 
this study are provided brieﬂy. Finally, section 8 concludes our work.
2. Literature review
A nation can not prosper without educating its citizens (Edu, 2023). 
Because of this, a lot of scholars have worked hard to determine how 
they might predict students’ performance using a variety of factors. (Asif 
et al., 2017) addressed three major questions in their work. For this, they 
used university exam marks from the ﬁrst two years. At an early stage, 
they predicted students’ performance, relating index courses that can 
serve as pointers of low or high performance, and relating typical signs 
of progress. They used ten classiﬁers to predict performance. In their 
study, they described that there is a reasonable relationship between 
students’ ﬁnal examination results with their previous internal college 
examination marks. Also, they suggested some impactful subjects. They 
claimed that by giving more emphasis on these courses, students could 
perform better on examinations.
(Mishra et al., 2014) used data mining for students’ performance pre-
diction. Finding a comparatively better prediction model and the impact 
of various attributes on students’ performance were the main objectives. 
The dataset contained marks, socio-economic, and demographic data of 
the students. Diﬀerent classiﬁcation techniques were used to build a per-
formance prediction model based on students’ semester marks, social 
integration, academic integration, and emotional skills. J48 and Ran-
dom Tree were applied to predict the third semester performance of 
students, with Random Tree found to be more accurate than J48. The 
authors also identiﬁed attributes that inﬂuenced students’ third semester 
performance.
The performance of university students was predicted at an earlier 
time by (Meghji et al., 2023) using 291 university students data. They 
also made an eﬀort to ﬁnd out how the courses aﬀected the students’ 
performance. They used decision trees for their purpose. Additionally, 
they proposed a framework for segmenting students based on their per-
formance, which can be used to create practical educational policies.
(Baradwaj & Pal, 2011) delved into students’ academic performance 
at the end of the semester and identiﬁed dropout students. They used 
some attributes that are related to students’ semester results like previ-
ous semester marks, performance, assignment, attendance, last semester 
marks, and so on to predict performance. They used decision tree for 
prediction.
In a recent work (Tasnim et al., 2019) proposed a threshold based 
approach that can be used to identify drop out students’ using some 
attributes like student’s sex, travel time, current health status, number 
of school absences, and so on. They showed that their threshold based 
approach gives better classiﬁcation results compared to naive bayes, 
logistic regression, and support vector machine.
(Golding & Donaldson, 2006) examined the correlation between stu-
dents’ performance (e.g. GPA) and predictor courses in the Bachelor of 
Science and Information Technology (BSCIT) program. They examined 
that lectures that ensure foundation concepts are tutored and under-
stood by students can be one of the major factors for success. Though 
they also used demographic factors for predicting performance, they 
found no relation between them.
In another work (Huang & Fang, 2013) predicted students’ ﬁnal ex-
amination marks using various types of mathematical models. They 
used a dataset collected from 323 undergraduate students in various 
semesters. In their dataset, they included marks in various subjects and 
also CGPA in four semesters. They concluded that for measuring average 
performance logistic regression performs better, and for determining in-
dividual performance support vector machine has the highest accuracy.
The study of (Mashiloane & Mchunu, 2013) focuses on using Edu-
cational Data Mining to predict ﬁrst year students’ success or failure 
based on ﬁrst semester marks at the university. Predictive models were 
obtained from the training data set using J48 classiﬁer, Decision Table, 
and Naive Bayes. J48 was found to be the better performing classiﬁer. 
The ﬁndings also suggest that ﬁrst semester marks can be an eﬀective 
factor for the prediction of ﬁrst year Computer Science ﬁnal results, po-
tentially helping to identify at-risk students for early intervention.
(Kaunang & Rotikan, 2018) conducted a comparative analysis be-
tween Decision Tree and Random Forest predicting the academic per-
formance of students using WEKA. The dataset contains students’ de-
mographics, previous GPA, and family background information which 
were used to construct students’ academic performance prediction mod-
els. This study’s main objectives were to ﬁnd a better prediction model 
and factors that aﬀect students’ learning behavior.
(Czibula et al., 2019) analyzed students’ academic performance pre-
diction using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. The au-
thors proposed a new classiﬁcation model, namely S PRAR (Students 
Performance Prediction using Relational Association Rules), which used 
relational association rules to predict students’ ﬁnal results in academic 
disciplines. Experiments on real academic datasets showed that S PRAR
outperformed other existing students’ performance predictors.
(Bujang et al., 2021) indicated the urgent need for predictive analyt-
ics in higher education and the challenges of using machine learning to 
predict student grades. The authors presented a comprehensive anal-
ysis of six machine learning techniques comparing their accuracy in 
predicting student grades using real student course data. Additionally, 
they proposed a multi-class prediction model to address imbalanced 
datasets. The model integrates with Random Forest to achieve signif-
icant f-measure improvement. This model showed promising results for 
enhancing predictive performance in imbalanced multi-classiﬁcation for 
student grade prediction.
(Yang & Li, 2018) predicted students’ performance and suggested a 
few elements that are crucial for advancement. They demonstrated how 
students could improve more by concentrating on those characteristics.

According to Guzmán et al. (2007), a self-evaluation test could be a 
crucial tool for students’ progression.
The previous studies show that academic marks, socioeconomic sta-
tus, demographics, and other variables, might aﬀect a student’s per-
formance. Researchers have predicted student performance using both 
single and multiple factors. In this paper, we have used a single attribute 
i.e., academic marks to predict students’ performance. Since no algo-
rithm consistently produces the greatest outcomes, as indicated by the 
previous studies, we have used ﬁve machine learning algorithm mod-
els that are appropriate for obtaining the objectives of this study. In 
addition, the majority of the previous study revolved around binary clas-
siﬁcation; but, this study introduces multi-class classiﬁcation, which will 
enable us to more precisely determine each student’s performance level. 
Besides, predicting the students’ performance was the main concern of 
most of the previous studies, but this study has further addressed various 
performance factors for students’ level of performance. Thus, this study 
has additionally explored subjects’ impact on results and introduced in-
dividual, group-wise performance observation, consistent performance 
trend monitoring, which are the unique contributions of this study.
3. Data mining techniques
In this study, we used ﬁve machine learning algorithms for analyz-
ing students’ academic performance from various perspectives. For the 
ﬁrst and fourth research objectives, all of the ﬁve machine learning al-
gorithms are used. Then we selected one of these models based on the 
highest classiﬁcation performance to extract performance related fur-
ther insights. In the case of the second research objective, we only used 
Decision Tree with various statistical criteria to visualize the DT model 
prediction outcomes as a bundle of subjects and conditions. In this way, 
subjects and their impact on academic results are extracted from analyt-
ical results with the help of machine learning algorithms. Besides, this 
study has proposed a model to classify individual and group wise stu-
dent performance in the third research objective without using any help 
from machine learning algorithms.
3.1. Decision tree
Decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used 
for classiﬁcation problems. It is a tree-like structure where each node 
represents a decision, and the branches represent the possible outcomes 
of that decision. The goal is to use the features of the dataset to create 
a tree that can accurately predict the target variable (Tangirala, 2020). 
Decision tree works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based 
on the values of the features. At each step, the algorithm selects the 
feature that best separates the data into the purest subsets, meaning that 
the subsets contain mostly one class or category. This process continues 
until all the data is classiﬁed or a stopping criterion is met (Asif et al., 
2017). There are several methods for selecting the best feature to split 
the data, such as Information Gain, Gini Index, and Accuracy.
Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy or uncertainty 
in the target variable when a feature is used to split the data. Features 
that provide the most information gain are selected ﬁrst (Han et al., 
2022). Gini Index measures the impurity of the target variable in a sub-
set. Features that reduce the Gini Index mostly are selected ﬁrst (Han et 
al., 2022). Accuracy simply selects the feature that leads to the highest 
accuracy on the training data (Han et al., 2022).
Some decision tree graphs generated by using Accuracy, Gini Index, 
and Information Gain criteria concerning board GPA analysis are shown 
in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These ﬁgures represent three overﬁtted 
decision trees that resemble complex trees with many levels. The trees 
result in less interpretability, poor generalization and classiﬁcation, and 
a negative impact on model performance. On the other hand, Fig. 4 for 
proposed GPA-1 analysis and Fig. 5 for proposed GPA-2 analysis repre-
sent a much better interpretation of the features and better classiﬁcation 
performance of the machine learning model.
3.2. K-nearest neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a simple and intuitive classiﬁcation 
algorithm. It works by ﬁnding the ‘K’ training data points (neighbors) 
in the dataset that are closest in terms of distance to the new data point 
being classiﬁed (Kramer & Kramer, 2013). The Euclidean distance is of-
ten used to calculate the neighboring distance. It is the smallest distance 
between any two neighbors and is always a straight line (Leung et al., 
2013). The majority class label among these K-Nearest Neighbors is then 
assigned as the predicted class label for the new data point. The num-
ber of nearest neighbors, K = 1, is often used for binary classiﬁcation 
tasks (Kramer & Kramer, 2013). But, this study focuses on multi-class 
classiﬁcation and thus increasing value of K is required for better per-
formance which is similar to the work by (Yuan et al., 2008). In this 
study, the number of nearest neighbors is ﬁxed at K=5. However, K-NN 
can be sensitive to noisy data, and the choice of ‘K’ impacts the model’s 
performance. Also, the prediction can be computationally expensive, es-
pecially for large datasets, as it requires calculating distances for each 
new data point against all training examples (Sun & Huang, 2010).

3.3. Naïve Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for 
classiﬁcation tasks (Duda et al., 1973). The algorithm is based on Bayes 
theorem and assumes that all features in the data are independent of 
each other (Friedman et al., 1997). The algorithm calculates the prior 
probabilities of each class based on the frequency of each class in the 
training set. It also calculates the conditional probabilities of each fea-
ture given each class based on the frequency of each feature in the 
training set. When a new instance is presented, the algorithm calculates 
the probability of the instance belonging to each class based on the prior 
and conditional probabilities. The class with the highest probability is 
then predicted as the class of the new instance (Ren et al., 2009).
Bayes theorem ﬁnds the likelihood of an occurrence given the prob-
ability of another event that has already occurred (Efron, 2013). Bayes 
theorem can be deﬁned by equation (1).
𝑃(𝐶|𝑋) = 𝑃(𝑋|𝐶) ⋅𝑃(𝐶)
𝑃(𝑋)
(1)
where,
𝑃(𝐶|𝑋) ∶posterior probability of target class
𝑃(𝑋|𝐶) ∶likelihood that is probability of predictor of given class
𝑃(𝐶) ∶prior probability of class
𝑃(𝑋) ∶prior probability of predictor of class
3.4. Neural networks
Neural Networks are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired 
by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of a 
network of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are organized 
into layers (Beale & Jackson, 1990). Each neuron receives input from 
other neurons of other layers, processes the information, and produces 
an output that is transmitted to other neurons in the network. The basic 
structure of a neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hid-
den layers, and an output layer (Beale & Jackson, 1990). The input layer 
receives the input data, and the output layer produces the output. The 
input data is processed by the hidden layers, which also extract features 
for use in forecasting or making judgments (Beale & Jackson, 1990).

Weighted links that control the strength of the connections between 
the neurons in a neural network connect the neurons. During training, 
the weights of these connections are adjusted to help the network learn 
to recognize patterns and generate accurate predictions (Müller et al., 
1995).
3.5. Random forest
Several decision trees are used in the Random Forest ensemble learn-
ing technique to get more precise predictions. Both classiﬁcation and 
regression tasks can be accomplished using this well-known and eﬀec-
tive machine learning technique (Tangirala, 2020). The fundamental 
principle of Random Forest is to build many decision trees, each trained 
on a random subset of the training data and a random selection of 
characteristics (Tangirala, 2020). This randomization aids in lowering 
overﬁtting and enhancing the model’s generalization capabilities. Dur-
ing training, each decision tree is grown using a modiﬁed version of the 
CART (Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees) algorithm. At each node of 
the tree, a subset of the features is randomly selected, and the best split 
is chosen based on the Gini impurity or entropy of the data. To make a 
prediction for a new instance, the algorithm passes the instance through 
each decision tree in the forest and aggregates the results. For classiﬁ-
cation tasks, the class with the highest frequency among the predictions 
is chosen as the ﬁnal prediction.

with better class wise data distribution is also used for ﬁrst research 
objective. This study contains marks data of four internal academic ex-
aminations (Half Yearly, Yearly, PreTest, Test), each with seven subjects 
marks data of 309 college students of academic batch (2018-2019) and 
data of 1000 students in synthetic dataset shown in Table 1. The dataset 
consists of the attributes listed in Table 2 that relate to internal exam-
ination subject marks and internal examination GPA, board GPA, and 
proposed GPA.
The interval of marks is divided into three categories: Good (60%-
100%), Average (50%-59%), and Poor (0%-49%). The class-wise student 
distribution statistics are shown in Table 3 for the college dataset and 
the synthetic dataset in Table 4. Fails are counted as poor performance 
and students dropping out are not investigated in this work. Every stu-
dent’s marks in examinations are calculated in between 0 (Worst) to 100 
(Best) for the college dataset and in between 30 (Worst) to 90 (Best) in 
the synthetic dataset. Selected mark range in the synthetic dataset has 
been proved to successfully generate random marks that resulted in the 
desired multi-class dataset while several other possible ranges failed to 
do so. All data mining methods have been implemented using Rapid-
Miner software and manually coded at Google Colaboratory to obtain 
the required evaluation metrics.

4.2. Experimental methodology
In the time of COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, internal college exam-
inations (Half yearly, Yearly, PreTest, Test) were already conducted in 
Bangladesh, but HSC-2020 could not be conducted (World Health Or-
ganization, 2019). The government had to reschedule the examinations 
multiple times but led to the postponement of the HSC examinations to 
ensure the safety and well-being of students considering the outbreak 
of COVID-19 (Star, 2021). Due to the uncertainty because of the pan-
demic and the challenges of conducting traditional examinations, the 
education boards in Bangladesh opted for alternative evaluation meth-
ods. Experts sought a universal standard to evaluate all students on the 
same scale. They suggested evaluating HSC results based on JSC and SSC 
results to prevent academic session jams among multiple batches during 
emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic (Tribune, 2020). Therefore, 
HSC result was calculated as 25 percent of the JSC result and 75 per-
cent of the SSC result, and the education board had issued an ordinance 
as legal support for this result (Alo, 2020).
We observed that our concerned college had a 100% pass rate con-
sidering the board GPA. However, a considerable portion of students’ 
internal examination performance was poor and the students might fail 
in HSC examination. This points us towards the signiﬁcant impact of 
COVID-19 on HSC results. We, therefore, seek an answer to a question: 
What if the HSC examination had been conducted in normal circum-
stances, what should be the results? For this reason, we investigated 
the students’ performance in internal academic examinations as well as 
in HSC GPA, addressing the ﬁrst and second research objectives of this 
study. Thus, three analysis cases arise concerning board GPA, proposed 
GPA-1, and proposed GPA-2.
Five classiﬁcation algorithms with diﬀerent criteria were used to pre-
dict intermediate college students’ HSC examination performance at the 
end of two-year HSC degree. This ﬁnds the answer to our ﬁrst research 
objective that seeks classiﬁer prediction performance of obtained HSC 
GPA in terms of internal examination performances.
Table 3 presents class wise distribution of students’ performance in 
college dataset and Table 4 displays the same for synthetic dataset. Class 
‘Good’ has the most students in college dataset and class ‘Average’ has 
the most students in synthetic dataset for board GPA analysis. Again, 
for proposed GPA-1 and proposed GPA-2 analysis, class ‘Poor’ has the 
most students in college dataset and class ‘Good’ has the most students 
in synthetic dataset. 5-fold cross-validation technique is used to evalu-
ate the performance of the classiﬁcation models. Preliminary analysis 
steps of this study include data pre-processing, proposed GPA calcula-
tion, multi-class label generation, and building classiﬁer models shown 
in Fig. 6.
First research objective aims to ﬁnd students’ internal examination 
performance patterns and relate to academic ﬁnal performance using 
several classiﬁers. Three comparable analysis scenarios arise because
this study proposes two candidate GPA based on central tendency (mean 
and weighted sum) criteria along with board GPA. When calculating 
HSC subject-wise marks, the proposed GPA-1 technique uses the aver-
age of four internal examination subjects’ marks. On the other hand, 
proposed GPA-2 approach implies the weighted sum of subject marks. 
Then subject marks are converted to equivalent GPA using standard GPA 
mapped to a predeﬁned mark range. The subject-wise marks in HSC 
examination are calculated based on internal examination subject-wise 
marks using two diﬀerent formulas. Equations (3) and (4) are used for 
proposed GPA-1. Equations (5) and (6) are used for proposed GPA-2 gen-
eration. In this way, HSC GPA is proposed based on internal examination 
performance. First research objective uses evaluation metrics such as ac-
curacy, weighted F1-score, and Cohen’s kappa to predict the class of the 
student performance with reasonable precision.
Second research objective of this study targets to ﬁnd out academic 
performance and subjects relationship in each of the three mutually 
comparable analysis cases. This paves a way for non-technical person 
to understand the research outcomes because it presents more general-
ized and human interpretable outcomes. It is possible with the help of 
decision tree graphs shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These obtained deci-
sion trees selected a few of the internal examination subjects to classify 
students according to performance class. Thereby represent correlation 
between subjects and students performance. Using only one impurity 
criterion such as information gain, gini index or accuracy can not be a 
wise choice as each of them behaves biased towards the dataset’s ma-
jority class Han et al. (2022). That’s why, to reduce biased outcomes, 
a novel approach is used to decide predictor subjects using an outcome 
voting technique within all impurity criteria which interprets DT graph 
nodes from a special angle.
Third research objective focuses on ﬁnding every student’s perfor-
mance in terms of subjects. Thus categorizes all subjects as performance 
boosters, degraders, and at-risk subjects. It also presents a summarized 
view of each subject and the number of aﬀected students by it as booster, 
degrader, as well as at-risk subjects. Finally, this objective points out 
every student’s current academic performance and suggests low-eﬀort 
performance enhancer subjects to improve results. Besides, booster sub-
jects are deﬁned as subjects that assist in performance increase, degrader 
subjects as performance reducers, and at-risk subjects as already failed 
or fail-prone subjects. At-risk criteria are ﬁxed for subject marks less or 
equal to 40, whereas the passing mark baseline is 33.
Fourth research objective focuses on ﬁnding consistent student per-
formance using previous internal examination performance trends. Con-
sequently, it results in early detection of upcoming internal examina-
tion’s most probable estimated performance. Five classiﬁcation models 
are used for this purpose and performance has been evaluated using 5-
fold cross-validation. This study proposes a novel approach that aims to 
ﬁnd a correlation between half yearly examination subject marks and 
yearly examination GPA. The classiﬁcation result resembles a consistent 
performance pattern of students in consecutive two internal examina-
tions - half yearly and yearly, yearly and pretest, pretest and test. Since 
the ultimate goal is to perform excellently in upcoming internal and 
HSC examinations, this objective can provide very useful insight, such 
as forecasting performance and detecting continuously static performer 
students who are either consecutive good, consecutive average, or con-
secutive poor performers. First and second research objectives of this 
study include a comparison of three GPAs shown in Fig. 6 and their 
corresponding formulas are covered in the equations (2) - (6).

5.1. Objective 1 - predicting HSC examination performance using classiﬁers
To predict students’ performance, we used diﬀerent classiﬁers. Ta-
ble 5 represents the classiﬁcation performance for the board GPA and 
our proposed GPA for both datasets. From Table 5, we can see that in 
both of our proposed approaches accuracy is nearly twice that of the 
board-obtained GPA for the college dataset. Also in a synthetic dataset, 
our proposed GPA provides better accuracy than the board GPA. In the 
case of college dataset, for board GPA Random Forest with Gini Index 
(RF-GI) gave an accuracy of 57.28% which is higher than other clas-
siﬁers. For proposed GPA-1, RF-GI has the highest accuracy which is 
96.45%. For proposed GPA-2, Neural Networks have the highest accu-
racy which is 95.48%. Additionally, RF-GI performs better overall in 
both of our proposed methods. However, Neural Networks in the syn-
thetic dataset oﬀer the highest accuracy for both the proposed GPA-1 
and the board GPA, at 86.5% and 79.6%, respectively. On the other 
side, Naive Bayes oﬀers the maximum accuracy for the proposed GPA-
2, which is 83.2%.
Table 6 represents another performance measuring tool called Co-
hen’s kappa. From this table, we can see that for the college dataset, the 
highest kappa value for our proposed GPA-1 is obtained for Neural Net-
works which is 0.604. Also, for our second proposed GPA highest kappa 
value is obtained for 5-Nearest Neighbour which is 0.593. Whereas the 
board GPA’s highest kappa value is 0.210, obtained for RF-GI classi-
ﬁer. However, Neural Networks provide the highest kappa values for 
both the proposed GPA-1 and the board GPA in the synthetic dataset, 
at 0.681 and 0.719, respectively. On the other hand, Naive Bayes pro-
vides a maximum kappa value of 0.675 for the proposed GPA-2. Here, 
we can see that the board GPA’s kappa value is lower than both of our 
proposed GPAs. Hence, it can also be said that our proposed GPA cal-
culations are more closely related to the student’s internal exam scores 
than their board GPA.
Table 7 represents F1-score for board GPA and proposed GPA for 
both of our datasets. From the analysis of the college dataset, we can 
see that, for board GPA and proposed GPA-1, Random Forest with In-
formation Gain (RF-IG) oﬀers the highest value. For the board GPA, 
it is 49.93% and for the proposed GPA-1 it is 95.49%. On the other 
hand, 5-Nearest Neighbour oﬀers the highest F1-score for the pro-
posed GPA-2 which is 93.19%. In contrast, Naive Bayes provides the 
highest F1-score for board GPA and two proposed GPA calculations, 
which are 73.6%, 85.14%, and 81.88%, respectively, in the synthetic 
dataset. Table 7 shows that the proposed GPA performs better overall 
in terms of F1-score. In brief, the analytical outcomes suggest that the 
proposed GPA calculations are more closely aligned with students’ in-
ternal examination performance than with their board GPA. Tables 8, 
9, and 10 represent the confusion matrix of the board GPA and our 
two proposed GPA calculations. Through the confusion matrices, we 
can identify the right and wrong predictions for each class made by 
the classiﬁers.

5.2. Objective 2 - relating predictor subjects and their impact with students’ 
performance prediction
For the second research objective, we need to connect decision tree 
visualization with the prediction performance of board and proposed 
GPA calculations. After the distillation of decision tree (where attribute 
selection was performed by information gain, gini index, and accuracy) 
and merging decision tree graphs outcome (selective attributes) using 
voting method, an impact score is assigned per subject as its total node 
count shown in Table 11. This resembles how much each subject is im-
portant for student performance. The higher the score, the higher the 
subject’s importance.
Table 11 summarizes the importance of every subject for student 
performance. After analysis, the most important subject for the board 
GPA and proposed GPA-1 prediction is English and for the proposed 
GPA-2 is Bangla. Whereas the least important subject for board GPA 
is Optional, for proposed GPA-1 are Civics and Optional, for proposed 
GPA-2 are Civics and Islamic History. Besides, board GPA classiﬁcation 
uses all of the 7 subjects with maximum total node counts 103, pro-
posed GPA-1 classiﬁcation uses 5 out of 7 subjects with only total node 
counts 12, and proposed GPA-2 classiﬁcation uses 7 out of 7 subjects 
with only total node counts 17. Therefore, it is understandable that de-
cision tree model has too many branches that lead to overﬁtting and 
poor generalization on unseen data (poor model accuracy) in board GPA 
classiﬁcation. On the other hand, the proposed GPA calculations have 
eﬃcient attribute selection and better model generalization as well. In a 
summary, students performance by proposed GPA calculations and sub-
jects have stronger correlation than board GPA.

In addition, from the Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, it is seen that board GPA 
classiﬁcation accuracy is below 60% using 27 out of 28 attributes. On 
the other hand, proposed GPA-1 and 2 have almost double classiﬁcation 
accuracy (about 90%) using only 9 attributes. This indicates that pro-
posed GPA calculations have signiﬁcantly high correlation with students 
internal examination performance than board GPA. The proposed two 
GPA calculations relate more to student performance because they have 
no assumption about good results in JSC and SSC examinations, which 
indicates good result in HSC examination and based on board GPA (Alo, 
2020).
5.3. Objective 3 - continuous performance progression of students
Third research objective investigates for valuable insights about 
group wise and individual students performance progression in the basis 
of subjects through internal academic examination. At ﬁrst, we deter-
mined individual students’ (random student with roll x) GPA booster, 
degrader, and at-risk subjects in half yearly, yearly, pretest, and test 
examinations as shown in Table 12. Besides, a visual perspective of 
individual student performance in 7 subjects within each internal ex-
aminations is shown in Fig. 7 which reveals strong and weak points of 
individual student. Secondly, categorizing all subjects into performance 
booster, degraded, and at-risk subjects by number of overall aﬀected stu-
dents in all four internal examinations as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a shows 
that English has aﬀected no student as performance booster, 309 stu-
dents as performance degrader, and for 304 students it was at-risk sub-
ject in half yearly examination. Similarly, Fig. 8b shows that Optional 
subject has aﬀected 240 students as performance booster, 69 students 
as performance degrader, and for 65 students as at-risk subject in yearly 
examination. Fig. 8c presents pretest examination statistics, where it is 
clear that English has aﬀected 3 students as performance booster, 306 
students as performance degrader, and 295 students as at-risk subject. 
Similarly, Fig. 8d shows that English is the most performance degrader 
and at-risk subject in test examination as well.
Moreover, Table 13 shows student’s respective half yearly, yearly, 
pretest, and test examination’s current performance standing and perfor-
mance booster subjects with minimum eﬀort. In Table 13, roll y (random 
student) has poor performance currently after half yearly examination 
and for performance improvement to average, he/she must do well in 
Optional, Islamic History, Sociology, Civics, ICT, Bangla, and English. 
Besides, roll y has average performance currently after yearly exami-
nation and for performance improvement to be good, he/she must do 
well in Civics, Islamic History, and English. Again, roll y has poor per-
formance currently after the pretest examination and for performance 
improvement to average, he/she must do well in Bangla and English. 
Similarly, roll y has poor performance currently after the test examina-
tion and for performance improvement to average, he/she must do well 
in English, Civics, and Bangla.

5.4. Objective 4 - consistent performance pattern early detection
Table 14 represents the classiﬁer accuracy and Table 15 represents 
weighted F1-score. These two tables represent how precisely consistent 
performer students can be detected using their consistent performance 
in two consecutive previous internal examinations. From Table 14, it can 
be seen that Naive Bayes has the lowest classiﬁcation accuracy perfor-
mance while RF-GI has the highest classiﬁcation accuracy performance 
which is absolutely satisfactory performance. Table 15 also supports se-
lection of RF-GI model. Because it has the highest weighted-F1 score 
to correctly detect consistent performer students after consecutive in-
ternal examination periods (3 scenarios: after yearly examination, after 
pretest examination, after test examination). It has been found from the 
analysis of confusion matrix of RF-GI that there were 6 consistent good 
performer, 3 consistent average performer, and 260 consistent poor per-
former students after half yearly and yearly examination. This model 
has found consistent performance pattern of 269 students out of 309 
students. Similarly, there were total of 281 consistent performers with 
5 consistent good students, 10 consistent average students, and 266 con-
sistent poor-performing students after yearly and pretest examination. 
In the same way, a total of 283 consistent performer student with 4 
good, 2 average and 277 poor performer were there after pretest and test 
examination had occurred. This indicates that, after the yearly exami-
nation and before the pretest examination, about 87.05% of consistent

performer students were there. Through early intervention, 260 poor 
performers and 3 average performers could be handled for performance 
improvement. Also after the pretest examination and before the test ex-
amination, about 90.94% of consistent performer students were there. 
Thus, 266 poor performers and 10 average performers could be helped 
for performance improvement with early intervention. Finally, 91.58% 
early detected consistent performing students could be treated for per-
formance boost between the period between test examination and HSC 
examination where 4 good, 2 average, and 277 consistent poor per-
former students might get a chance to do better result. Ultimately, the 
goal is to do better performance in HSC ﬁnal examination. Consistent 
performance patterns appear to be a very important insight for the early 
identiﬁcation of at-risk, struggling, and good-performing students. By 
appropriate guidance and monitoring, the performance of these students 
can be improved.
6. Limitations and future work scopes
One of the limitations of this research is absence of students’ so-
cioeconomic and demographic features in the dataset. These data can 
greatly impact on academic performance of students. Besides dataset is 
quite imbalanced because it is collected from real world situations re-
sulting in a few instances of good result-holder students. Also, no class 
imbalance and feature selection related study is addressed in this re-

search. Moreover, one combined ﬁnal mark per subject is considered 
here in place of subject-wise written, multiple-choice question (MCQ), 
practical marks to avoid analysis complexity. Increasing student data 
samples and collecting students’ socioeconomic, and demographic fea-
tures in the dataset using surveys can be a crucial future work scope. In 
addition, generalization of the ﬁndings for more college students’ data 
can be another crucial work direction. Association rule mining during 
classiﬁcation can be used to gain insights into the factors that contribute 
to student performance.
Besides proposing academic policies, initiatives through deep in-
sights for performance improvement can be an extension of this work. 
Moreover, threshold-based approach for classiﬁcation purposes and 
comparing among classiﬁcation performance of traditional classiﬁers 
can be another work direction. Furthermore, ensemble or voting meth-
ods against traditional classiﬁcation model comparison can be possible 
to implement. After all, the application of a novel approach to address 
typical performance progression can be accomplished. Finally, consis-
tent performer student detection using previous examination perfor-
mance trends can be an interesting working trajectory.
7. Theoretical and pedagogical implications of this study
The study conducted in this paper has both theoretical and pedagog-
ical implications. The implications are stated below in accordance with 
the four research objectives of this study.
Research Objective 1 (Machine learning models with several performance 
evaluation metrics): We proposed two reasonable techniques for calcula-
tion of HSC GPA based on college internal examination performances. 
Thus, a comparison between proposed and board GPA can be conducted 
and relevancy with internal college performance can be found. This also 
helps to observe how a pandemic situation like COVID-19 had aﬀected 
the students’ results.
Research Objective 2 (Visualization and interpretation of decision tree 
graphs): Finding impact factors of subjects on student results can be 
helpful for both college authority and students to ﬁnd out the strong 
and weak zones of subjects.
Research Objective 3 (Extracting subject-wise performance knowledge by 
using novel approach of proposed python model): Finding the performance 
progression of students after each internal examination can surely guide 
upcoming performance boost. Outcomes like categorization of each sub-
ject as performance booster, degrader or at-risk subject, and low eﬀort 
performance booster subjects are crucial aspects of student performance 
that can be utilized by college authorities to act wisely for performance 
improvement.
Research Objective 4 (Consistent performance trends detection using ma-
chine learning models and interpretation of confusion matrix): Identifying 
groups of students who perform consistently similar after consecutive in-
ternal examinations is an interesting performance aspect to distinguish 
students as consistently good, consistently average, or at-risk of failure. 
Therefore, college authorities can surely monitor, motivate, and provide 
special care to each group of students by using these valuable insights.
8. Conclusion
This study investigated four research objectives to provide valuable 
insights about academic performance. This might help to improve the 
student’s academic performance and institutional educational quality 
as well. The ﬁrst objective concerns predicting students’ HSC exami-
nation performance using internal examination marks only, while no 
socio-economic data are available. The classiﬁcation results based on 
both college and synthetic dataset show that the proposed GPA calcu-
lations have better classiﬁcation performance than board GPA. In other 
words, the proposed GPA is more relevant to internal examination per-
formance than the board GPA. Besides, the second objective aims to 
identify the impact of subjects on student performance. Visualization 
of decision tree shows that proposed GPA has better attribute selec-
tion and better classiﬁcation than board GPA. Board GPA has over-ﬁtted 
decision tree and poor attribute selection with poor classiﬁcation per-
formance. Impact of subjects on classiﬁcation performance shows that 
the most important subjects for board GPA are English, ICT, and Is-
lamic history, for proposed GPA-1 are English, ICT, and Bangla, and 
for proposed GPA-2 are Bangla, English, and Sociology. This resembles 
the importance of subjects for GPA classiﬁcation. The third objective 
investigates how every student’s subject-wise academic performance 
progresses over the two-year degree. Our proposed method for contin-
uous performance progression can identify every student’s performance 
booster, degraded, and at-risk subjects. It also represents individual stu-
dent’s low-eﬀort performance booster subjects. Besides, every subject 
can be categorized as booster, degrader, and at-risk subject based on 
the number of aﬀected students. These outcomes can certainly aid in 
comprehending the subject and current student performance relation-
ship. Therefore, a strategy to help struggling students can be deduced 
based on valuable informative results. Through more eﬃcient academic 
assessment methods and improved teaching strategies, teachers will be 
able to more readily identify children who are at-risk and take the re-
quired measurements to support their academic performance recovery. 
The fourth objective examines consistent performance patterns based 
on two consecutive internal examination performances. Classiﬁcation 
results indicate that RF-GI has the highest classiﬁcation performance 
and has correctly detected the highest amount of consistent performer 
students. According to confusion matrix analysis, there are 86.0% con-
sistent performer students after yearly examination whereas 90.9% after 
pretest and 91.6% consistent performer students after test examination. 
Earlier detection of consistent performer students can signiﬁcantly help 
to identify bright, struggling, and at-risk students. Consequently, college 
authorities can formulate academic strategies to guide, monitor and mo-
tivate bright students as well as take immediate steps for performance 
improvement of struggling and at-risk students.
