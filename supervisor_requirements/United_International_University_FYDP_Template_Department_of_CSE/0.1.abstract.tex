Student attrition and academic underperformance remain critical challenges in higher education institutions worldwide. Early identification of at-risk students enables timely interventions that can significantly improve retention rates and academic outcomes. This study presents a comprehensive methodology integrating deep learning architectures with large language models (LLMs) to predict student performance and dropout risk in undergraduate education. We analyze a dataset of 4,424 students from a European higher education institution, incorporating 46 features spanning demographic, academic, socioeconomic, and macroeconomic dimensions. The features are systematically mapped to established theoretical frameworks: Tinto's Student Integration Model and Bean's Student Attrition Model. Three neural network architectures are developed: (1) Performance Prediction Network (PPN) for multi-class grade forecasting, (2) Dropout Prediction Network with Attention mechanism (DPN-A) for binary dropout classification with interpretable feature importance, and (3) Hybrid Multi-Task Learning network (HMTL) for simultaneous performance and dropout prediction. The methodology incorporates self-attention mechanisms, multi-task learning, and GPT-4 integration for generating personalized intervention recommendations. Rigorous evaluation employs stratified 10-fold cross-validation, comprehensive metrics, statistical significance testing, and SHAP-based feature importance analysis. The DPN-A attention-based model achieves 87.05\% accuracy and 0.910 AUC-ROC for dropout prediction. This research provides both predictive accuracy and actionable insights through LLM-generated recommendations, representing a novel contribution to intelligent student support systems.
