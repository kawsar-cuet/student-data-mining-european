RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Neural Network deployment:
  Use ANOVA F-stat with 15 features
  Expected accuracy: 0.7684
  Feature reduction: 55.9%

Neural networks benefit from:
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler applied to all configurations)
- Reduced feature sets (less prone to overfitting)
- Early stopping (prevents overfitting on training data)
- Adaptive learning rate (improves convergence)

The neural network shows strong performance, competitive with ensemble methods.
Feature selection improves NN performance by reducing dimensionality and
preventing overfitting, especially important for deep learning models.
