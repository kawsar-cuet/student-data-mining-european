SHAP ANALYSIS DETAILS
================================================================================

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):
- Unified approach to explain model predictions
- Based on game theory (Shapley values)
- Shows how each feature contributes to predictions
- Provides both global and local interpretability

Explainers Used:
- TreeExplainer: Decision Tree, Random Forest
- KernelExplainer: Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Neural Network (model-agnostic)

Visualizations Generated (per model):
1. Feature Importance Bar Chart - Shows mean |SHAP| value per feature
2. SHAP Summary Plot (Beeswarm) - Shows feature impact distribution

================================================================================

INTERPRETATION GUIDE
================================================================================

Feature Importance Bar Chart:
- Higher bars = more important features
- Shows average magnitude of impact across all predictions
- Useful for ranking features globally

SHAP Summary Plot (Beeswarm):
- Each dot represents one student's prediction
- X-axis: SHAP value (impact on prediction)
- Color: Feature value (red=high, blue=low)
- Position: Feature importance (top=most important)
- Spread: How feature values affect predictions

How to Read SHAP Values:
- Positive SHAP value: Increases prediction probability
- Negative SHAP value: Decreases prediction probability
- Magnitude: Strength of the effect
- Sum of SHAP values + base value = model prediction

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. All models now have explainability through SHAP analysis
2. Feature importance varies across models, showing different learning patterns
3. XGBoost achieves highest accuracy with comprehensive feature set
4. Decision Tree provides simplest interpretation with fewest features
5. SHAP values enable stakeholders to trust and understand predictions
6. Different explainer types used based on model architecture

This analysis provides complete transparency into how each model
makes predictions, essential for educational intervention systems.
